I am a data science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

 * Lab 4, Part 2 
 It was fun designing the game logic instead of just playing, it felt like solving a real puzzle.
 I learned how to use “if” statement better by figuring out the win/lose conditions step by step.
 And testing the game with different guesses was kind of satisfying, especially when it printed the right message. 

* Lab 6, Part 1 
I liked how we used command line arguments.
The error checking helped me understand how to make programs look better.
The test cases made it easier to see if my code was actually doing what it should. 

* Lab 7 
This lab was interesting because we had to translate real world parking signs into working code.
I liked changing time and day to code for each street.
It was also good practice for input validation and making sure our program did not work with bad input.
